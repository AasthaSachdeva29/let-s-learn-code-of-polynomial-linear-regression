Polynomial linear regression is a variation of the linear regression algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In traditional linear regression, the relationship is assumed to be a straight line. However, in polynomial linear regression, the relationship is modeled as a higher-degree polynomial, such as a quadratic (degree 2) or cubic (degree 3) equation.

The algorithm fits a polynomial equation to the data, allowing for curved or nonlinear relationships between the variables. This enables the model to capture more complex patterns in the data. Polynomial linear regression involves finding the coefficients of the polynomial equation that best fits the data, typically using techniques like least squares optimization. It is a flexible and powerful tool for regression analysis when the relationship between variables is not linear.
